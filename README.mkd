# Hebel

## Self Hosted Placeholder Application
Hebel is open source software to generate quick and simple image placeholder.

Like these services:

- [placehold.it](http://placehold.it)
- [placehold.jp](http://placehold.jp)


## How does it work?

Just put your image size after our URL and you'll get a placeholder.

Like this:

```
http://hebel.yourdomain.com/100x100
```

You can also use it in your code, like this:

```html
<img src="//hebel.yourdomain.com/300x300">
```

Have fun!
